# RawReadingNTFSDelphi

This is the code from 2009-2010. 

Reading raw data directly from NTFS filesystem to recover files, Windows, Delphi. 
Reading MFT, Attributes, Clusters, Compressed, Sparse, Uncompressed blocks, etc.

The code is entirely written by me and represents individual work based on the book: Brian Carria - Forensic Analysis of File Systems

Also, I independently developed code from scratch for reading raw FAT16 and FAT32 file systems with Delphi, for file recovery. Same source (a book)
